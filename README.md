# Mission: Portfolio (Aman Kumar)

Welcome to **Mission: Portfolio**. This is a personal portfolio website designed with a **Retro Sci-Fi / Cyberpunk Terminal** aesthetic. It mimics a recovered data interface from a futuristic or retro-computing system.

## 🌟 Features

-   **Immersive Retro Theme**: complete with CRT scanlines, screen flicker, and a "phosphor" green glow.
-   **System Boot Preloader**: Simulates a kernel boot sequence before loading the main interface.
-   **Interactive Window System**:
    -   Draggable "Mission: Portfolio" window.
    -   Minimize, Maximize, and Close functionalities.
    -   Taskbar integration for restoring minimized windows.
-   **Typewriter Effects**: Real-time typing animation for the biography section (HTML-aware).
-   **Desktop Environment**: Clickable desktop icons to navigate different sections (Recovered Data, Projects, About, Skills, Contact).
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts the terminal interface for mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: Custom animations (keyframes for scanlines, blinking cursors), flexbox/grid layouts, and CRT overlay effects. No external CSS frameworks used.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for dragging, window controls, typing effects, and preloader sequencing. No external JS libraries.
